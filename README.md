# GitHub Page of Jesus Rafael Rijo

My name is Jesus Rafael Rijo Candelario. I am currently a computer science and mathematics double major at Mercer University, intending to graduate after May 2023.

Although I am interested in many areas of computer science and applied mathematics, my greatest interest is on high performance computing.

This Github page contains various projects I have made throughout the years. To comply with Mercer University's *Honor Code*, various projects are left under 
private repositories. Thus, several projects listed below will not appear publicly. If you would like to see one or more of these projects, please contact me
