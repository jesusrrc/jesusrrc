# GitHub Page of Jesus Rafael Rijo Candelario

My name is Jesus Rafael Rijo Candelario. I am currently a computer science and mathematics double major at Mercer University, intending to graduate after May 2023.

Although I am interested in many areas of computer science and applied mathematics, my main interests are on high performance computing and applied mathematical modeling.

This Github page contains various projects I have made throughout the years. To comply with Mercer University's *Honor Code*, various projects are left under 
private repositories. If you would like to see one or more of these projects, please contact me at jesusrrcinco [at] gmail [dot] com.
